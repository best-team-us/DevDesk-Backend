          Later in the article it says:
          Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration, its options if you may. They are received from above and immutable.
          So props can change but they should be immutable?
          When should you use props and when should you use state?
          If you have data that a React component needs, should it be passed through props or setup in the React component via getInitialState?`,
